> **Mushin (ÁÑ°ÂøÉ):** A mind not fixed or occupied by thought or emotion and thus open to everything. A state of effortless action, achieved when the self is forgotten.

This application is a tool built on that philosophy. It automates the mundane, allowing you to enter a state of uninterrupted workflow. It is simple, purposeful, and unobtrusive.

***

## ‚ùØ Core Pillars

Mushin is designed around three fundamental principles:

*   ### Fluidity
    Effortless control is paramount. A global `F6` hotkey allows you to start and stop the process from anywhere, without ever needing to switch focus to the application window. Your flow is never broken.

*   ### Precision
    Every detail is at your command. A smooth, real-time slider provides tactile control over the Clicks Per Second (CPS), while a clear dropdown menu allows for instant selection of the Left, Right, or Middle mouse button.

*   ### Simplicity
    There is no configuration, no installation, and no clutter. Mushin is a single, self-contained executable that leaves no trace on your system. It is a tool, not a burden.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  Navigate to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/zanderooo/Mushin-Clicker/releases/latest) page.
2.  Download `Mushin.exe` from the latest release (`v0.0.1`).
3.  Run it.

> [!NOTE]
> Windows SmartScreen may show a warning as the app is not code-signed. This is standard for small, independent projects. Click `More info` ‚Üí `Run anyway` to proceed.

## üó∫Ô∏è The Path Ahead

This is the foundational version of Mushin. The path forward is focused on expanding its quiet utility.

-   [ ] **Linux Support:** Porting the application for native execution on Linux distributions.
-   [ ] **Configurable Hotkeys:** Allowing users to define their own activation key.
-   [ ] **Profiles:** Saving and loading different configurations for various tasks.
